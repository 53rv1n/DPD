# Defensive programming and debugging MOOC

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the FutureLearn MOOC
[*"Defensive programming and debugging"*](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/defensive-programming-and-debugging).

Here you will find source code that you can use for the quizzes.  It
will grow over time since we will add example solutions at the end of
the week, as well as the material for the coming week.  So you should
keep an eye on it.

You have three options to use this repository,

  1. Simply download the individual files as you need them.
  1. Clone the repository: straightforward, but you should make copies
     of files if you want to modify them.
  1. Fork the repository: best approach if you are familiar with the
     procedure.


## Alternative 1: download individual files

This is the simplest approach if you are not familiar with version
control systems.

  1. Navigate to the file you want to download.
  1. Click on the `Raw` button, your browser window will show the
     source code only.
  1. Use `Save As` to save the file to your computer.

The drawback is that you will not get updates  automatically in case
we add or fix material.


## Alternative 2: clone the repository

You can clone this repository using the following  command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gjbex/DPD
```

This will create a directory `DPD` that contains your clone of the
repository that you can use to work in.  When material is added to
the repository, you can update the repository using:

```bash
$ cd DPD
$ git pull origin master
```

Note that if you modified files in the repository, the pull will fail.
Hence first copy files before you modify them.  Copies can reside in
your repository directory, so you can simply work there.  


## Alternative 3: fork the repository

This is definitely the best approach but you need to be familiar with
the procedure.  If you use this alternative, we assume you know what you
are doing.
